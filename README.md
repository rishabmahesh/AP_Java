# AP_Java

The following are programs that I wrote as practice problems during my preparation for the Computer Science AP exam.
I had learned java anew and I found it similar to C++. 
As a programmer, I learned Arrays, ArrayList, Recursion, 2D Array, and Inheritance to an intermediate level.

As of today, I am learning about java data structures and files management.
